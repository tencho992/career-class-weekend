# My Career-Class-Weekend project
This excercise allowed me to practice my skills in grabbing elements in html and using conditionals. This was a project created on the first day of week 4. I am emmensly proud of this work because it was my first introduction to javascript and I had so much fun with it. Basic Fundamentals of JavaScript.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, 

This project mainly consists of learning very basic JS statements. 

Starting with more focused and smaller projects allowed me to embrace versatile functions and all its capabilities. In doing so, I was also able to strength my CSS skills while diving deep into focus mode on very basic fundamental functions.
